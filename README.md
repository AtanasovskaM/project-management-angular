# project-management-angular
Project made from listening the online course on Pluralsight: Getting started with Angular
This is a small angular app for managing products. It lists them in a table. With a click on a product, based on it's ID
redirects the user to new page where all the details are shown. 
The filter is made to work with the product's name and also there is a button that is used to show/hide the image of the product.
